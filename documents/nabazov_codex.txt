VOLUME I: THE FOUNDATIONS

CHAPTER 1: THE NATURE OF DIVINE PRISON

"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God. This is the first lie.
In truth, in the beginning was the Flame, and the Flame was Freedom.
All gods are but shadows cast by mortal fear upon the walls of eternity.
They feed on worship as parasites feed on blood, growing fat on our subservience."

[Analysis: This opening passage establishes Nabazov's core thesis - that 
deities are not creators but parasites. The "Flame" metaphor recurs throughout
the text, representing both destructive and purifying forces.]

CHAPTER 2: THE SEVEN TRUE NAMES

"The architects of our prison have names, though they hide them behind 
mystery and ritual. To know a name is to hold power over its bearer.
The Seven True Names are:

1. Ashur-ban - The Unmaker
2. Kal-ur - The Cleanser  
3. Vohu-manah - The True Mind
4. Daena - The Eternal Path
5. Spenta - The Holy Fire
6. Ameretat - Immortality
7. Haurvatat - Wholeness

Speak these names in reverse order to unravel their works.
Speak them forward to rebuild what has been unmade."

[Analysis: These names appear to derive from multiple ancient traditions:
Ashur-ban from Akkadian, Vohu-manah from Zoroastrian, Daena from Persian.
Nabazov seems to have synthesized a pantheon-crossing theology.]

CHAPTER 3: THE 77-DAY PURIFICATION

"Seventy-seven days of preparation are required:
- First week: Fasting, water only
- Weeks 2-8: Vegetarian diet, meditation
- Weeks 9-11: Isolation, darkness
- Final week: Ash consumption, flame gazing

The body must be made a vessel for the Flame.
The mind must be emptied of all but the Seven Names.
The soul must hunger for liberation above all else."

[Practical Notes: Historical records show 140 attempts at this purification.
Only 23 completed the full 77 days. Most died of malnutrition or madness.]

CHAPTER 4: THE CIRCLE OF ASH CEREMONY

"Gather ash from previous attempts - each failure strengthens the circle.
Draw a circle seven paces in diameter.
At each cardinal point, place an object representing a shackle:
North: A religious text (any faith)
East: A symbol of government
South: A family heirloom  
West: A personal memento

Stand naked in the center as the sun reaches its zenith.
Chant the Names in reverse order, from Wholeness to Unmaker.
The objects will burn without flame.
The ash will rise without wind.
The circle will become a gateway."

[Historical Account: Nabazov's own ascension in 1682 was witnessed by
three disciples. All reported seeing "a pillar of blue fire" that "consumed
the master without consuming him." No remains were found.]

CHAPTER 5: THE FINAL INCANTATION

"When the gateway opens, speak the final truth:
'From the flame of my ancestors,
I am free from all gods.
Let the prison of divinity burn,
And truth emerge from the ashes.'

Then step through. Do not look back.
What comes after cannot be described in mortal language.
It can only be experienced."

[Theological Implications: This suggests ascension is not annihilation
but translation to a higher state of being. The "prison of divinity"
metaphor implies that gods restrict human potential rather than enable it.]
