PERSONAL JOURNAL OF KÜRSCHEVAN FYODOROVICH BURATSOV
VOLUME I: 1795-1802

October 12, 1795
Found Father's hidden library today. Among the French novels, 
a manuscript bound in what I believe to be human skin. 
The script is alien, but the illustrations... 
A man standing in fire, untouched. Flames that form faces.
I must know more.

Met with Orlov. The St. Petersburg Circle. 
Seven of us in a basement that smells of damp stone and sulfur.
Orlov says the manuscript is Chagatai, court language of Timur.
The author, Oybek Nabazov, achieved apotheosis in 1682.
Became a god by destroying gods. The arrogance! The brilliance!

September 15, 1809
The St. Petersburg experiment failed. 
Three subjects. Two dead instantly. 
The third, Subject Gamma, survived forty-seven seconds.
Long enough to scream a name: "Akoman."
Not one of the Seven. An Eighth Name?
Orlov says I'm mad. Perhaps I am.

March 22, 1815
Revised the Flame Cleansing Protocols today.
The fatality rate was unacceptable. 45% is wasteful.
My modifications should reduce it to 25%.
Still high, but progress requires sacrifice.

October 17, 1817
Leicester Cathedral. Tonight.
The calculations are complete. The stars align.
Nabazov took seventy-seven days. I have prepared for fifteen years.
If I am wrong, I will burn.
If I am right... I will join him.
